On the html file, I put an alt attribute and described the photos for accesability. I then changed the title so the company name would appear on the tab. Lastly, changed some things to class to make the code more appealing and cohesive.

On the css file, I consolidated some attributes where they could be consolidate (see in-line notes). This is turn made the code more appealing. I also got the search engine optimazation button to flash to where it needed to.
